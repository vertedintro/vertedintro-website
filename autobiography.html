      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Reah Mae A. Obando, and I am 18 years old. I was born on May 21, 2007 and raised in Suba Masulog, Basak, Lapu-Lapu City. 
        I'm currently a first year college student taking the BIT course. I am passionate, determined, and also consider myself as a quiet and creative 
        person who likes to observe, learn new things, and exploring different experiences. I strive to improve in everything I do.

      <p>
        I started my education at Suba Masulog, Basak, Lapu-Lapu, where I built my foundation in learning. I continued my studies at Marigondon National 
        High School and developed a deeper interest in technology and creativity. Later, I attended Benthel Asia School of Technology, where I took the 
        STEM strand. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor in Industrial Technology (BIT) course in college, continuing to enhance my technical knowledge 
        and skills.

      <h2>‚ú®Likes and Dislikes</h2>
      <hr>
        <p>
          I like spending my free time watching movies and animes. I also like foods, cats, rain, summer, singing songs that are in different languages
          and being alone to have time for myself. However, I dislike cramming and procrastination because they'll stop my progression on learning new things.
